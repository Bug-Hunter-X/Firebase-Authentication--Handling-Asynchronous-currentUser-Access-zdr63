The Firebase Authentication SDK might throw an unexpected error if the `currentUser` property is accessed before the authentication state has fully initialized.  This commonly occurs when attempting to access user data immediately after app launch or within a component's `componentDidMount` lifecycle method.  The asynchronous nature of Firebase authentication means that the `currentUser` might be `null` initially even if a user is signed in.  This can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior.  For example:

```javascript
// Incorrect:
componentDidMount() {
  const user = firebase.auth().currentUser; // Might be null
  // ... use user data ...
}
```
